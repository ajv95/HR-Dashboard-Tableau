## 🧭 Summary View

The dashboard is published via Tableau Public and can be found here: [View the Live HR Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aj.v3290/viz/HRDashboardTableauproject/HRSummary?publish=yes). 

The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data.

The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.

I wanted to have a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

The summary view is divided into three main sections: **Overview**, **Demographics**, and **Income Analysis**.
